:package:
* At the main folder of the project a package.jason has to be created by installing the packages of inquirer and fs. in a index.js file we have to require inquirer, fs as well as a generateMarkdown.js file that alos needs to be created. After requiring the packages an array of questions need to be created followed by a fuction that uses inquirer to prompt questions. The apropriate parameters must be met and can be found in the npm documentation of inquirer. followed by a method that will write the answers into the generatemarkdown file that was created and the index file must end witha function to initialize the program. In the generatemarkdown.js file we have to start by creating a function that will generate the markdown and the apropriate style can be added there. At the end its important to export the module. we finish by runnig node index.js from the terminial and answering the questions that are prompted. at the end a Readme.md file should be generated with the styling that you want.
